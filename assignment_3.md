# Assignment 3

Write a program that defines a Mammal class. Define four classes that inhert
from your Mammal class: Cow, Duck, and Human. Each mammal should define the
following methods:

* `#eyes` (returns 2 for all Mammals)
* `#legs` (returns 2 for a Duck or a Human; 4 for a Cow)
* `#speak` (Cow says "moo"; Duck says "quack"; Human says "hello")

Implement the `#legs` method for Duck and Human in a Bipedal module.
